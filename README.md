# Open-Source-Modular-Lithium-Battery-Pack
The purpose of this project is to create an open-source, modular, and reconfigurable battery pack for electric transportation. This would include methods of transport as small as skateboards and scooters to larger vehicles such as electric cars. As it would be open source, individuals can build their own battery pack for their projects. The pack is designed with modules of lithium ion, 18560 cells in parallel to reach the desired capacity and current requirements; with each module connected in series to reach the desired voltage. Each module in the pack can be modified and customized for any project to fit size, power requirements, thermal management strategies, etc. Because the batteries already exist, only the cell spacers for each module will need to be manufactured and tested. To make each module as affordable as possible, some of the components will be 3D printed. Overall, this design will provide individuals with a battery pack that is customizable for their electronic vehicle project needs.
